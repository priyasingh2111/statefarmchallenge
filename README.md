As good neighbors, we treat others with respect, dignity and empathy, creating a welcoming environment where everyone feels they belong, can grow and thrive. All of us own the responsibility to exemplify inclusive behavior in every relationship â€“ at school, at work, or in the community. We work with others to make the world around us a better place. Create a digital experience (a game, application, etc.) that supports these goals by promoting understanding, diversity, and inclusion.
